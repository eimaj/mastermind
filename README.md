# Mastermind.js

Written (mostly) on a red-eye flight to Las Vegas for a trade show. The rest was written while lost in a casino.

Inspired by [@agentultra](https://github.com/agentultra) and his laundromat demos as well as [@jstimpfle](https://github.com/jstimpfle/tetris-on-a-plane/) and his Tetris on a plane implementation.

Uses HTML/CSS/JS and no dependancies. The initial app was built at about 30,000 feet with no internet access. I got a little caught up in design details, but I really enjoyed figuring things out without any dependencies or libraries.

You can play a live version of the game here: [mastermind.eimaj.dev](https://mastermind.eimaj.dev/).
